Notes:
- Added Webview linking to Wiki with polygon name as parameter
- Added animation using Quartz framework. Took quite a bit of effort to get this working and the documentation was not great... I did it as I have time this week and may not have as much time for the main project due to work commitments so wanted to try things out now and get as much done as possible.
- Added Modal and Push Seques - missing them does not really look great but wanted to get a feel for both
- Tried to stick strictly to MVC paradigm and use protocol delegates where ever appropriate
