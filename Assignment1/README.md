Note: Added some animation to try out linking the MVC view controller mechanisms:
- clicking on the logo will start the logo switching between 4 different images every couple of seconds. Clicking again will stop this and return to the initial logo
- 'long pressing' the logo and holding it will cause the logo to flip upside down
